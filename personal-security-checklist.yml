  intro: >-
    Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, default or stolen passwords
    (according to [this Verizon report](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_dbir-2016-executive-summary_xg_en.pdf)).
    Use long, strong and unique passwords, manage them in a secure password manager, enable
    2-factor authentication, keep on top of breaches and take care while logging into your accounts.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a Strong Password
    
    details: >-
      If your password is too short, or contains dictionary words, places or names- then it can be easily
      cracked through brute force, or guessed by someone. A strong password needs to be at least 12 characters long. The easiest way to make a strong password is by
      adding three random words together. Alternatively,
      use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with
      [HowSecureIsMyPassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net), to get an idea of how quickly common
      passwords can be cracked. Read more about creating strong passwords:
      [securityinabox.org](https://securityinabox.org/en/passwords/passwords-and-2fa/)

  - point: Don't reuse Passwords
  
    details: >-
      If someone was to reuse a password, and one site they had an account with suffered a leak, then a
      criminal could easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts. This is usually done through
      large-scale automated login requests, and it is called Credential Stuffing. Unfortunately this is all
      too common, but it's simple to protect against- use a different password for each of your online accounts

  - point: Save your passwords to the browser
    
    details: >-
      [According to research from Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/global-password-health-score-report-2022), the average person has about 240 online accounts. It's not going to be possible to remember a strong, unqiue password for all of these.
      But we can let our device do the remembering for us by saving our passwords to the browser. It is easy to do this; when we create an online account, a box will pop up saying "Do you want to save this password?" - just click "yes".
      It might feel like we shouldn't save our passwords to the browser, but doing this is the safest way of protecting your passwords. 
      

  - point: Avoid sharing passwords
  
    details: >-
      Never share your passwords with anyone online. This helps to stop other people being able to access your account. 

  - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    
    details: >-
      2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a
      code on your phone) to log in. This means that if anyone has got your password (e.g. through phishing,
      malware or a data breach), they will not be able to log into your account. It's easy to get started,
      download an authenticator app (such as Authenticator) onto your phone, and then go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA. Next
      time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code that displays in the app on your phone
      (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30-seconds)

  - point: Keep Backup Codes Safe
    
    details: >-
      When you enable 2FA, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
      your 2FA method is lost, broken or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
      unauthorised access. You should store these safely on paper or in an encrypted file on your device.

  
- title: Web Browsing
  slug: web-browsing
  description: Avoiding tracking, censorship, and data collection online
  icon: browser
  intro: >-
    Most websites on the internet will use some form of tracking, often to gain
    insight into their users behaviour and preferences. This data can be incredibly
    detailed, and so is extremely valuable to cyber criminals. Data breaches and leaks are common, and it is easy for cyber criminals to find
    out who you are from the data they have gathered.


    There are two primary methods of tracking; stateful (cookie-based), and stateless
    (fingerprint-based). Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in your browser
    with a unique ID that is used to identify you. Browser fingerprinting is a highly
    accurate way to identify and track users wherever they go online. The information
    collected is quite comprehensive, and often includes browser details, OS, screen
    resolution, supported fonts, plugins, time zone, language and font preferences,
    and even hardware configurations.


    This section outlines the steps you can take, to be better protected from threats,
    minimise online tracking and improve privacy.
  checklist:
  - point: Block Ads
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy, by blocking the trackers that ads implement.
      [uBlock Origin](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/ad-blockers/ublock-origin) is a very
      efficient and open source browser addon, developed by Raymond Hill.
      When 3rd-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the ability to
      track you, gathering personal information about you and your habits, which can then be sold, or used
      to show you more targeted ads. This can be annoying, but worse are scam adverts for fake products. Blocking ads also makes pages
      load faster, uses less data and provides a less cluttered experience.

  - point: Ensure Website is Legitimate
   
    details: >-
      It may sound obvious, but when you logging into any online accounts, double check the URL is correct.
      Storing commonly visited sites in your bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When
      visiting new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: Browser warnings, redirects,
      on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a website using a tool, such as:
      [URLVoid](https://www.urlvoid.com) if you are unsure. To use URLVoid, paste the web address you want to visit into the search bar and hit search.
      URLVoid then scans through databases of malicious websites to see if it appears in these. If it does appear, it will have a detection count of 1+. This means it is unsafe to visit.
      The only safe detection count is 0. Think of it like snakes in your bed - the only safe number of snakes in your bed is 0. 

  - point: Remove Unnecessary Browser Addons
    
    details: >-
      Extensions are able to see, log or modify anything you do in the browser, and some innocent looking
      browser apps, have malicious intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed, and may
      use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/ track you. Both Firefox and Chrome
      web stores allow you to check what permissions an extension requires before you install it.
    Only install extensions you really need, and removed those which you haven't used in a while.

  - point: Keep Browser Up-to-date
    
    details: >-
      Vulnerabilities in your browser are constantly being discovered and fixed (through something called a patch). Making sure your browser is up to date means that cyber criminals can't 
      exploit weaknesses in your browser, helping to keep you safe. You can [see which browser
      version you're using here](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/), or  [check out this guide for instructions on how to update](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-update-your-browser/)
      Some browsers will auto-update to the latest stable version.

  - point: Check for HTTPS
   
    details: >-
      At the beginning of a web address will either be HTTP or HTTPS. This is called the protocol. The S in HTTPS stands for secure. 
      This means that your data is encrypted while it is transported. Websites with an HTTP protocol (with no S) do not use encryption, so your data 
      is available to be read by anyone who intercepts it. You should only enter any information into a website with an HTTPS protocol. The protocol is often shown as either a green
      or black padlock (HTTPS) or a broken padlock or a warning triangle (HTTP). 
      However, it is important to remember that this doesn't mean the website is safe - cybercriminals set up fake websites with HTTPS addresses because they look legitimate. 
      HTTPS is about how your data is transported, not about who the person is at the other end. 

  - point: Block Third-Party Cookies
    
    details: >-
      Third-party cookies placed on your device by a website other than the one you’re visiting. This
      poses a privacy risk, as a 3rd entity can collect data from your current session. When you visit any website that uses cookies, 
      they should tell you about what cookies they are using and for what purposes. This will be in a pop up that you have to close before you can
      use the website. Don't just accept all cookies, turn off everything that can be turned off, or reject all. 

  

- title: Email
  slug: email
  description: Protecting the gateway to your online accounts
  icon: email
  intro: >-
   Although the first email was sent more than 50 years ago, it's still very much a big part
    of our day-to-day life. Considering how much trust we put in them, it's surprising to find out how fundamentally insecure this
    infrastructure is. Email-related fraud [is on the up](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247670/email/email-security-in-2018.html),
    and without taking basic measures you could be at risk.
    

    If a hacker gets access to your emails, there are two big problems:
    1. Your emails hold a huge amount of information about you, which can be used by hackers in further cyber attacks and identity theft
    2. It provides a gateway for all of your other accounts to be compromised through password resets.

    Getting your email security right is one of the best things we can do to stay safe online.
    
  checklist:
  - point: Have more than one email address
    
    details: >-
      Consider using one email address for important accounts like banking, social media or official services (like benefits), and a different address for less important stuff like shopping and newsletters.
      This is called compartmentalising, and it will reduce the amount of damage caused by a data breach: if a website you shop on has a data breach,
      cyber criminals won't be able to link any details stolen to your important email account.
      Having a separate email account also means you can recover your email passwords more easily. 

  - point: Keep Email Address Private

    details: >-
      Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often the starting point for most
      phishing attacks.

  - point: Keep your Account Secure
  
    details: >-
      Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA and be careful while logging in. Your email account
      provides an easy entry point to all your other online accounts for an attacker.

 
 - title: Messaging
  slug: messaging
  description: Keeping your communications private and secure
  icon: messaging
  intro: One of the things we use our devices - especially our phones - for is messaging. We might use services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Telegram. Messaging is a great way to keep in touch, share news, and share important files. 
  But like everything else online, we need to think about staying safe before we send any messages. What do we need to know?
  checklist:
  - point: Only Use Fully End-to-End Encrypted Messengers
 
    details: >-
      End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where messages are encrypted on your device and
      not decrypted until they reach the intended recipient. This ensures that your message cannot be read if it is 
      intercepted by a cyber criminal. Platforms such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Android Messages are end-to-end encrypted.
      Facebook Messenger is not currently end-to-end encrypted.
      
  - point: Check Security Settings
  
    details: >-
      Enable security settings, including contact verification, security notifications, and encryption.
      Disable optional non-security features such as read receipt, last online, and typing notification.

  - point: Ensure your Recipient's Environment is Secure
   
    details: >-
      Your conversations aren't secure if the person you're speaking to isn't in a secure place. Before sending anything sensitive, 
      ask your recipient if they are in a safe place to recieve important personal information. If they are not,
      then wait until they are. 

   
  
 
- title: Social Media
  slug: social-media
  description: Minimising the risks that come with connecting to people online
  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and give
    people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and share.
    Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction and
    bring people together, they are also loved by cyber criminals, because they allow them to 
    connect with millions of potential victims, and the data available on social media can
    make targetting individuals easy. 

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even
    after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is
    effectively public. 
  checklist:
  - point: Secure your Account
    
    details: >-
      Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To protect your account: use a unique
      and strong password, and enable 2-factor authentication.

  - point: Check Privacy Settings
  
    details: >-
      Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure that you are comfortable with
      what data you are currently exposing and to whom.

  - point: Think of All Interactions as Public and Permanent
    
    details: >-
      Even if we set our privacy settings to the most private, we can't guarantee our private content doesn't become available. Someone with access to our content could screenshot and share it, or our account could be hacked.
      And once something is online, it can be impossible to get it removed if someone has made a copy of it.
      Therefore, before uploading, posting or commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public for the rest of my life?"

  - point: Don't Reveal too Much
   
    details: >-
      When you create your profile on some social media platforms, you are encouraged to give as much detail about yourself as possible.
      But this information is valuable for cyber criminals, as it can help them create phishing scams targetted at you. Avoid
      uploading things like your date of birth, your hometown, and where you went to school.

  - point: Be Careful with what you Upload

    details: >-
      Status updates, comments, check-ins, images and videos can unintentionally reveal a lot more than you intended
      them to. This is especially relevant to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.

  - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number

    details: >-
      Never post your real email address or mobile number. Cyber criminals want these to help target 
      scams towards you. 
      
  - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
    
    details: >-
      When you download a social media platform's app, the app usually wants permission to do lots of things on your device. 
      It might want access to your files, your contact list, and your location. Think about what you want your 
      social media to do, and if it doesn't need the access. don't grant it permission to access it. 
      It is not likely that your social media needs access to your call log, for example. 

  
  - point: Avoid Publishing your location while still Onsite
  
    details: >-
      If you plan to share any content that reveals where you are, then wait until you have left that place.
      This is particularly important when you are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
      building or airport.

  intro: >
    This section covers how you connect your devices to the internet securely,
    including configuring your router and setting up a VPN.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a VPN

    details: >-
      Use a reputable, paid-for VPN. This can help protect sites you visit from logging your real IP, reduce
      the amount of data your ISP can collect, and increase protection on public WiFi.

  - point: Change your Router Password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      After getting a new router, change the password. Default router passwords are publicly available,
      meaning anyone within proximity would be able to connect.


  - point: Keep router firmware up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and
      sometimes add features or improve the performance of your router.

  icon: mobile
  intro: >
    Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the world
    to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means of communication,
    entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience
    to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on behind the screen.

    Geo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over
    who has this data- your phone is even able to
    [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371).
    Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your
    phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html),
    and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent.
    And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.

    Using a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you
    intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions.
    It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about
    us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend
    what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.

    This data is used for
    [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) -
    more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment.
    Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))

    More of us are concerned about how
    [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/),
    and rightly so, federal agencies often
    [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are
    made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence,
    [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html).
    And this doesn't include all of the internet traffic that intelligence agencies around the world have unhindered access to.
  checklist:
  - point: Encrypt your Device
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      In order to keep your data safe from physical access, use file encryption. This will mean if your
      device is lost or stolen, no one will have access to your data.

  - point: Turn off connectivity features that aren’t being used
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you're not using WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC etc, turn those features off. There are several common threats
      that utilise these features.

  - point: Keep app count to a minimum
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Uninstall apps that you don’t need or use regularly. As apps often run in the background, slowing your
      device down, but also collecting data.

  - point: App Permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Don’t grant apps permissions that they don’t need. For Android, [Bouncer](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/bouncer) is an app that allows you to grant
      temporary/ 1-off permissions.

  - point: Only install Apps from official source

  description: Using IoT devices without compromising your privacy
  icon: home
  intro: >-
    Home assistants (such as Google Home, Alexa and Siri) and other internet connected
    devices collect large amounts of personal data (including voice samples, location data,
    home details and logs of all interactions). Since you have limited control on what is
    being collected, how it's stored, and what it will be used for, this makes it hard to
    recommend any consumer smart-home products to anyone who cares about privacy and security.

    Security vs Privacy: There are many smart devices on the market that claim to increase
    the security of your home while being easy and convenient to use (Such as Smart Burglar
    Alarms, Internet Security Cameras, Smart Locks and Remote access Doorbells to name a few).
    These devices may appear to make security easier, but there is a trade-off in terms of
    privacy: as they collect large amounts of personal data, and leave you without control
    over how this is stored or used. The security of these devices is also questionable,
    since many of them can be (and are being) hacked, allowing an intruder to bypass
    detection with minimum effort.

    The most privacy-respecting option, would be to not use "smart" internet-connected
    devices in your home, and not to rely on a security device that requires an internet
    connection. But if you do, it is important to fully understand the risks of any given
    product, before buying it. Then adjust settings to increase privacy and security.

    Credit card fraud is the most common form of identity theft (with [133,015 reports in the
    US in 2017 alone](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/identity-theft-statistics/)),
    and a total loss of $905 million, which was a 26% increase from the previous year.

    sources (census records, birth/ death/ marriage certificates, voter registrants,
    marketing information, customer databases, motor vehicle records, professional/
    business licenses and all court files in full detail). This sensitive personal
    information is
    [easy and legal to access](https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/its-creepy-but-not-illegal-for-this-website-to-provide-all-your-public-info-to-anyone/),
    which raises some [serious privacy concerns](https://privacyrights.org/resources/public-records-internet-privacy-dilemma)

    CCTV is one of the major ways that the corporations, individuals and the government
    tracks your movements. In London, UK the average person is caught on camera about
    500 times per day. This network is continuing to grow, and in many cities around
    the world, facial recognition is being rolled out, meaning the state can know
    the identity of residents on the footage in real-time.

    Strong authentication, encrypted devices, patched software and anonymous web
